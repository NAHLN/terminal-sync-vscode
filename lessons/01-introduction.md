## Github codespaces: launch the learning environment

The learning environment will be a lightweight cloud computing setting that will be the same for everyone, and most similar to a server you may encounter in HPC.  We will use this setting for basic tutorials.


VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a free-to-use IDE (code editor with tools).  The version we use will launch in the github window, so no installation required.
