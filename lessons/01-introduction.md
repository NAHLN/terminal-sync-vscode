# Getting Started in this tutorial environment

## Github codespaces

1. Make sure you have an account [on Github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github#signing-up-for-a-new-personal-account). You will have to verify your email.
2. Next, navigate to this lesson repository: [terminal-sync-vscode](https://github.com/NAHLN/terminal-sync-vscode) and find the green button that says <mark style="padding: 3px; background-color: rgba(31, 136, 61, 1); color: white;"><> Code</mark>.

3. Click on that button for the pulldown box. This is normally where If you are logged into github, you will see a "CODESPACES" tab.

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a free-to-use IDE (code editor with tools).  The version we use will launch in the github window, so no installation required.
